# PostGIS GeoFaker

The project creates fake store and customer data with geospatial
components based on OpenStreetMap.  The use of OpenStreetMap data
as a starting point provides a sense of realism. The use of `random()`
and to generate fake data avoids privacy concerns.

See the [project documentation](https://geofaker.com) for more information.
