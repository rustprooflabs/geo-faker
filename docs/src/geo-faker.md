# What is Geo Faker?

The the Geo Faker project creates fake store and customer data with geospatial
components based on OpenStreetMap.  The use of OpenStreetMap data
as a starting point provides a sense of realism. The use of `random()`
and to generate fake data avoids privacy concerns.


> Warning: This project is in early development!  Things will be changing over the first few releases (e.g. before 0.5.0).


GeoFaker builds on [PgOSM Flex](https://pgosm-flex.com/), using its inherit ability
to be customized as a launching point to generate realistic looking, but absolutely fake
geospatial data.
